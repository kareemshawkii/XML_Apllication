This code is a comprehensive program that handles various operations on XML files, such as parsing, minifying, prettifying, converting to JSON, and compressing/decompressing. Additionally, it also builds and visualizes a graph based on user-followers data extracted from the XML. Here's a breakdown of its main components and functionality:

1. File Handling Functions:
readFile: Reads the content of an XML file into a string.
writeFile: Writes content to a specified file.
2. XML Parsing and Manipulation:
isXMLBalanced: Checks if the XML file is balanced (i.e., every opening tag has a corresponding closing tag). Logs any mismatched or unbalanced tags.
prettifyXMLFun: Beautifies (prettifies) the XML content by adding indentation and new lines to improve readability.
minifyXML: Strips unnecessary whitespaces, newlines, and indentation from XML content to reduce file size.
compressXML: Compresses the XML by replacing tags with tokens and saving both the dictionary of replacements and the compressed content.
decompressFile: Decompresses a previously compressed XML by using the saved dictionary to replace tokens with their original XML tags.
3. Conversion Functions:
toJSON: Converts an XML element to a JSON format.
printToJSONFile: Converts the parsed XML structure to a JSON file.
4. Graph Creation and Visualization:
Graph class: A generic class that represents a directed graph, supporting operations like adding vertices, adding edges, and visualizing the graph in DOT format.
generateGraphFromMap: Generates a graph from a user-followers map, where each user is a vertex, and a follower relationship is an edge.
ConvertDotToJPG: Converts the DOT format graph into a JPEG image using Graphviz.
5. Text Processing:
processText: Cleans up the XML content by removing unnecessary characters, leaving only meaningful text and tags.
6. Main Execution Flow:
The main function starts by reading an XML file and parsing it into an XML structure.
It then performs several operations on the XML file, such as converting it to JSON, minifying it, compressing it, decompressing it, and prettifying it.
The program also generates a map of user-followers and creates a graph from this data, which is then visualized and converted into a JPEG image.
Key Features:
XML Parsing: The program handles both simple and complex XML structures and allows for various transformations (prettifying, minifying, and compression).
Graph Creation: Based on the user-followers relationships, a graph is created and visualized.
JSON Conversion: The program converts XML data into a structured JSON format for easier manipulation or storage.
Compression/Decompression: The program compresses the XML file by replacing repetitive tags with tokens and later decompresses it back.
Summary of operations:
Parse an XML file.
Convert the XML data into JSON and save it to a file.
Minify the XML to remove unnecessary formatting.
Compress the XML by replacing tags with tokens, then decompress it.
Prettify the XML for better readability.
Generate a user-followers map, create a graph, and visualize it in a DOT format and JPEG image.
This program is useful for XML manipulation, data compression, graph-based analysis, and conversion between XML and JSON formats.
