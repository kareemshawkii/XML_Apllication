# XML Processing Utility

This project provides a set of utilities to handle various operations on XML files, including XML parsing, validation, conversion to JSON, minification, prettification, compression, decompression, and visualizing user data in a graph.

## Features

1. **XML Validation**
   - Check if the XML is balanced (correct opening and closing tags).

2. **XML Prettification**
   - Format the XML with proper indentation for better readability.

3. **XML Minification**
   - Remove unnecessary whitespace, newlines, and indentation from the XML to reduce size.

4. **XML Compression**
   - Compress the XML by replacing repetitive tags with tokens and saving the mappings.

5. **XML Decompression**
   - Restore a compressed XML by replacing tokens back with their original tags using a dictionary.

6. **XML to JSON Conversion**
   - Convert an XML file into a corresponding JSON format.

7. **Graph Visualization**
   - Generate a graph from user-followers data (extracted from XML) and visualize it in JPG format.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- C++17 or higher compiler.
- Graphviz installed (for visualizing the graph).
